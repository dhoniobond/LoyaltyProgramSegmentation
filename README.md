# LoyaltyProgramSegmentationInventory optimization across different stores

Introduction
This repository focuses on the application of customer segmentation through data modeling techniques for JCD, a fashion retail company. The objective of the analysis was to gain insights into consumer behavior and factors driving loyalty to identify customer segments and build a predictive model that could be used for targeting. The report describes the steps taken to explore the loyalty program data, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, clustering analysis, logistic regression, and linear regression. The report presents the findings of the analysis, including the characteristics of the customer segments and the factors that drive customer loyalty. The report concludes with recommendations for JCD to improve its performance and competitiveness by better understanding its customers and targeting its marketing efforts more effectively.

We have utilized a three-step approach using Python. Starting with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data, followed by Clustering Analysis to identify customer segments who are most likely to subscrbe to the proposed loyalty program. Finally, we used a supervised machine learning technique, Logistic Regression Model, to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not; followed by correlational analysis of purchases made with their respective categories.
